General Summary:

The study addresses the inefficient purchasing process at the Instructional Materials Distribution Center (IMDC) at the Cebu Institute of Technology - University (CIT-U). This current process is characterized by long queues, physical travel between distant buildings for payment, and resulting high levels of student frustration and dissatisfaction.

The researchers proposed and developed an online catalog system called "Teknoy Wildcarts" to provide a more streamlined, user-friendly, and efficient alternative for purchasing school necessities like uniforms and instructional materials.

The study's goal was to evaluate and compare the current system with the proposed "Teknoy Wildcarts" system in terms of efficiency, convenience, and user acceptance (based on the Technology Acceptance Model - TAM).

Key Finding:

The research concluded that the online IMDC ordering system (Teknoy Wildcarts) performs significantly better than the current manual system, showing much greater results in terms of efficiency (reduced elapsed time for purchase) and higher levels of acceptance across all categories of the Technology Acceptance Model. The online system is positioned as a viable alternative for customers seeking an efficient ordering method, especially when physical queues are long.
